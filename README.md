# User-Authentication-System

The sign-up module allows new users to create an account by providing their personal information. Once registered, users can then proceed to the login module, which verifies their identity using their usernames and passwords.

Upon successful login, users gain access to the user profile module. This module enables users to view their profile information. However, in order to ensure privacy and security, additional authorization measures have been implemented. When a user clicks on the "Show Details" button, they are required to authenticate themselves again to validate their authorization to view sensitive details.

Technologies used: React JS, Node JS, Express JS, MongoDB, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5, CSS3, HTML5
